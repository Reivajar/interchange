I am Adam Kor, a fourth year Bachelor of Arts in Architecture student with a minor in the History of the Arts from Hong Kong. I am an editor of interÂ·punct, a student journal for architecture at Carnegie Mellon. I have worked with the Carnegie Museum of Art and Point Line Projects in Pittsburgh, and LAAB Architects in Hong Kong. I am looking for 6 to 12 month internship opportunities upon graduation in May 2018. I would like to gain experience at an office that engages architecture at various scales and program types before continuing my graduate studies next year.
