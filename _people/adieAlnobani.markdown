Mass production of built structure is easy. Creating a complex and vivid experiences while tackling history, politics of cities, infrastructure, social issues, and functional requirement is interesting, intellectual and intriguing, it is design. Designing built structure to shape and redefine culture, influence city's structure and thinking of new potentials is architecture.

As John Frazer stated” the role of architects is not about designing a building or a city as to catalyze them to act as they may evolve”.

What defines me isn’t only my skills and experience, but questioning and thinking about new perspectives, provoking new models for design discourse involving technological advancement and media. I believe it is critical to rethink architecture in terms of material, design process, structure, and spaces. Designing architecture that can be defined beyond the convention and its static configuration is the present and the future.
