I am an Architect, developer, and machine learning enthusiast. Through my graduate studies, I have leveraged computational design, industrial robots, virtual reality, and recently machine learning to revive the essence of craftsmanship and build an intuitive digital dialogue between artisans, design, and artifacts.
