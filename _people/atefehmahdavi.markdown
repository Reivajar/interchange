I am a masters student studying Computational Design. I have a bachelor degree in Architecture and a master degree in Landscape architecture. I have been focused on architecture, context, and urban landscape in the past few years. Now I am here to merge design, context and technology. I believe what I have learned and experienced let me understand design as field which can lead individuals to be happy, people to interact and communities to thrive.
