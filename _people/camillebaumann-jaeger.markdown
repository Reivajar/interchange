I aim to reflect upon and explore the way spaces, objects, and experiences can work to create empathy and community, to go beyond received wisdom about the built world and extend these ideas to new realms of design. The kernel of my work is concerned with the way the parameters of a design can work subconsciously on a user, both as an individual and as a member of the crowd. This phenomenon is applicable to design beyond physical structures, extending to studies in social media, virtual reality experiences, and more. To this end, I now look to the ways in which virtual and hybrid spaces present new architectural opportunities and challenges.
