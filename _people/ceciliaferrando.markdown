I am a MSCD student and Fulbright scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.

After graduating with honors in Architecture and Economics&Statistics at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy, I came to CMU to explore the intersection of design, digital technologies and artificial intelligence. I love exploiting data to create innovative and meaningful designs.

My main interests are the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to design processes at all scales and robot-aided design, especially as applied to fashion design. I have past experience both as a project architect and as fashion designer. I am looking forward to gain more experience in any field related to digital design, machine learning and robotics.

Before coming to the U.S., I spent one year in Paris, France, where I studied at the ENSA Paris-Belleville and did research at the Rodin Museum.  

I love reading about science, technology and psychology.
