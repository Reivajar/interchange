Hello, my name is Dyani. I'm currently wrapping up my masters degree here at Carnegie Mellon with the ambition of pursuing a full time position after graduation. I'm trained in both architecture and musical (viola) performance. The work I engage with consistently seeks to blur the boundaries between architecture, fabrication and computational design.
