I am a young architect from Iran and I came to US after graduating from college. I’ve decided to continue my career path in the project management sector because I believe coordinating a project is an art and it requires both realistic and artistic visions. The combination of my experiences in both Architecture and Construction Management equips me well for that purpose. I’ve come to US for a brighter future and it is my second home now. I believe the sky belongs to no one and NO ONE can build a wall on it; Therefore, there is no limit (ban) for shooting the highest star.
