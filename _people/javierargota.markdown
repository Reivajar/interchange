I got my architect diploma in Madrid after being living in Paris and in Chicago. Before moving to Pittsburgh, I was working in Madrid in my own little practice, which I founded with a friend, where we develop our own projects which have been always related with new technologies, unconventional approaches and social engagement towards architecture and urban planning. However, even though I really love the work as architect, I know that there is still lot of discover, explore and research at the intersection of new technologies involving data science, programming, AI, machine learning, algorithmic thinking, and design. We haven't even started to explore the new possibilities we may find yet. And that is why I moved to Pittsburgh, to explore and improve my technical skills and engage new people who is looking forward to working in this direction.
