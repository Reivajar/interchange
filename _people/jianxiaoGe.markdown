I’m a first-year Master of Urban Design student who is applying for a summer internship. As a Hangzhou native, I witnessed the rapid development of China 's urbanization over the past decade. Study experience in Taiwan enables me to look from a unique perspective, which made me deeply realize that the China’s development offers both challenges and opportunities.

I'm interested in the Smart City. Relying on the support of native Internet companies such as Alibaba, Hangzhou is becoming the pioneer of China's Smart City. I would like to explore more possibilities of Urban Design with new technologies in the future.
