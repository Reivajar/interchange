Blurring limits, gathering cultures and collective minds. I apply this trio in my
(professional) life. I am an eager architect from Cordoba, south Spain. I moved
to Barcelona to get my architectural degree, and I would say this is my
adoptive city. I grew up personally and professionally in such an international
city that marked me as I am today. I worked for an international winning-
award office, Cloud9, where I matched perfectly with the “speculative-
experimental” philosophy of the company. Afterwards, I moved to London and I
worked there for a small company where the passion for the detail of the
construction was paramount. At the same time I was designing a single-
family house and, before coming to Pittsburgh, I went back to Spain to manage
the construction of my first work as a licensed architect. Let’s start the
architectural revolution!
