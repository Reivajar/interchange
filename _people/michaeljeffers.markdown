Go to my [Website](http://www.mikejeffers.com)!
Which will link to my [Github](https://www.github.com/mikejeffers) where you can see how it was [implemented](https://github.com/MikeJeffers/Portfolio-Site), an open-source [contribution](https://github.com/MikeJeffers/freecol-contrib), a [php script](https://github.com/MikeJeffers/DFAB-Reservation-Reminder) that annoys students on a daily basis, or my on-going [thesis work](https://github.com/MikeJeffers/MSCD-Thesis)!
Also I did some [Research](https://vimeo.com/iosignals) with Industrial Robotics.
