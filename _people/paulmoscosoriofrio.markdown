My name is Pa√∫l. I am a graduate student first year in the Master of Urban Design program at CMU. I am an architect from Ecuador, where I graduated in 2014. In 2015, I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study my master in the USA, where I will receive a degree in 2018. During my undergrad, I got involved in various leadership and community projects throughout LatinAmerica. My professional experiences include university research projects, architectural design projects for real estates developers, and urban projects of which I have been part of winning competitions. I am also involved in a multidisciplinary collective.
