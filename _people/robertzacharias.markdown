I am primarily interested in building hands-on experiences that give people the chance to learn about themselves and the world through engaging interactions. Before grad school, I studied social science, built a piece of nanofabrication laboratory apparatus from scratch, did hands-on education with kids in the South Bronx, and worked at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. The most beautiful place I've ever been was a decaying abandoned school in Poughkeepsie, NY.
