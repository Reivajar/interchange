I am an Architect currently pursuing my Masters in Construction Management. Watching a project transform from a conceptual design on paper to its brick and mortar reality is the beauty of this field and gives me immense satisfaction. My interests lie in project planning and coordination. I hope to achieve this by being involved in an architecture or real estate firm with exposure to projects of various programmatic scales.
