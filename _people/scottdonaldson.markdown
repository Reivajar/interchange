My research focuses on software for architecture and design, in particular exploring the socio-cultural effects of the computationalist paradigm embedded in parametric software.

Before joining the Computational Design program at Carnegie Mellon, I studied architecture at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation [(GSAPP)](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/). I have also worked as a web developer independently and for various organizations, including [AccuWeather](http://www.accuweather.com/) and the [Democratic National Committee](https://www.democrats.org/).
