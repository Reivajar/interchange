Hello, my name is Shannon Iacino. I am a Master of Science in Sustainable Design candidate whose current research focuses on passive design strategies and biomimicry. I am interested in examining how environmental and ecological feedback shapes the built environment and aim to obtain a full-time position at an organization that supports this holistic approach to design.
