I am a graduate student in my first year of the Advanced Architectural Design program. During the final year of my undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia, I was introduced to digital fabrication and have been passionate about the field ever since. I enjoy exploring how emerging technology can create innovative uses for common materials. During my time at Carnegie Mellon, I have become particularly interested in robotic fabrication and how interactive workflows between machines and humans can begin reshaping the fields of architecture and design.
