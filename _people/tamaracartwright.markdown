goal: Tamara is seeking a summer internship amongst a team of passionate individuals who value research, quality design, and clear graphical skills. She hopes to build upon her education in both architecture and urban design, blending the two fields to obtain a much richer understanding of urban spaces. It is important that she joins a team dedicated to the growth of their interns but also one that values positive impact design.

An activist in community engagement, with the strong belief that design directly influences a communityâ€™s quality of life. Tamara graduated with a Master of Architecture degree in 2015. As a fellow to the UDREAM program, she moved to Pittsburgh where she began a five-week intensive urban design exploration at Carnegie Mellon University. Following the program she accepted a full-time position at Design Center Pittsburgh as the Community Programs Manager. Her responsibilities included managing interns, conducting research analysis to inform future design opportunities, organizing and facilitating design charrettes between local architects and community groups, and preparing visioning reports and design guidelines for local neighborhoods. She now joined the Master of Urban Design program at CMU and is expected to graduate in May 2018.
