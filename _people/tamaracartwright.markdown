Tamara is an activist in community engagement, with the strong belief that design directly influences a communityâ€™s quality of life. She will be graduating in May with a Master of Urban Design degree and currently holds a Master of Architecture degree from Drury University (2015). 

As an urban designer and architect, she is seeking to merge her skills to assist with the urban revitalization and infrastructure development of neighborhoods and cities. Her passion is social development; she uses thorough research and strong presentation skills to actively engage stakeholders in a participatory design process that leads to greater resiliency and overall investment.

In the past she has organized and facilitated community design charrettes, worked on master plans, prepared visioning reports and design guidelines, managed teams of interns on several projects at a time, and conducted research analysis to pilot socially just programs.
