Hello, I am a graduate student in Master of science in Sustainable Design program. I believe building should become trees, and urban should become forest to respond external weather and climatic conditions to the benefit of interior occupancy requirements, including thermal, visual, acoustic, and air quality, while conserving non-renewable resources. I aim to obtain a full-time position at an organization that develop, demonstrate, and deploy sustainable built environment practices.
