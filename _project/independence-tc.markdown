The culmination of this community collaborative process was the development of this document and the more than 60-presentation boards and 3-PowerPoint presentations that were generated during the semester. This document Link Independence: Envisioning Connections 2040 presents the student design team’s recommendations based upon the collaboratively developed long-term vision for the design responses to the two given design challenges.

At the beginning of the design process, the design team spent a considerable amount of time in the City of Independence observing the community and talking with the Advisory Committee, city officials, and public. The team photographed all the buildings along the city center’s main corridors. Land-use, building conditions, and walkable characteristics were assessed. From these insights the team created a 30-year visioning plan for the city.

The design team’s intention is to increase the population density throughout the city center, which will help further support community economically.
The design team’s focus has been to restore the character of the traditional homes and neighborhoods while phasing out substandard homes and absentee landlord properties.

Without strong complete streets organization, the city center of Independence lacks linkage. The city center environment needs to be re-conceived as a pedestrian-oriented zone, not a vehicular-oriented zone. This guideline should be at the forefront of all decisions related to the city center and help to change the culture of the community.
