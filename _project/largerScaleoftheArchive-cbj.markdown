This project began with a central question: How can architecture manipulate and emphasize natural landscapes that are so often oppressed in New York City? This design sought to answer this question by creating a linked network of community spaces, indoor and out, intended to facilitate study, research, and community.

The programmatic elements of the design focus on enhancing visual continuity throughout the libraryâ€™s design. 
To achieve this goal, this project made central the use of parametric design methods combined with site analysis and user behavior research. Altogether, this design managed to unify diverse functional and social needs around a formal, structural system evident throughout the structure.
