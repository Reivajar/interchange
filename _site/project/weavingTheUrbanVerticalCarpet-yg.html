<p>The project locates in poor hillside villages in Busan, Korea, facing a dilemma of rejuvenation as other villages within the city. The villages possess meaningful historical endowments, however left with wrecks caused by wars; they are in desiring need of development, but isolated from the main city for a long time and lack of activation. 
Our strategy is to reconnect the sites within and with the outside by various methods: adding catalyst and vigor to beat the heart of villages in society level, just like weaving a vertical carpet to make connections.What we would like to foresee is that the villages thrive and survive in metropolitan with precious historical memories and traditional Korean characteristics as a livable community for refugees to spend their happy old age and a possibility of activation of the city in the future.</p>

<p>During urban renewal in the 1970s, superblocks were introduced
to East liberty in order to segregate pedestrian from
automobile flows. Meanwhile the lack of building density
within the superblocks also led to vast open, undefined and
often neglected public spaces.
In the past, East Liberty was subject to divestment and
shrinking, leaving many vacant lots in between existing
building. Our proposal reinterprets the resulting porosity
of the urban fabric as a potential asset for creating a fine
grain network of public spaces punctured by buildings of
varying scales, and a mix of market rate and affordable
housing.
The existing diversity of building scales and uses is essential
to East Liberty’s vitality, as it attracts different socio-
economic classes and a variety of commercial opportunities.
Our proposal aims at maintaining such diversity,
while further integrating and evenly distributing buildings
and programs of different nature and type. Accordingly
the master-plan is based on a wide variety of building and
green space typologies.</p>

<p>As the site has existed for a long time in history under the circumstance of complex topography, historical events which have influenced it all the time that brought about its unique characteristics but also issues. As the collage at bottom shows: war refugees, hillside agriculture, informality with topography brilliant view of the port and the city, and lonely residence are the main factors compose the site, they are thorny to handle, but of many possibilities to be created.</p>

<p>Concept
Phase 1: Cracks between the city, mountain and the site.</p>

<p>Phase 2: Weaving the vertical carpet to make a connection within the site and with the outside.</p>

<p>Phase 3: Adding catalyst to revive the whole site and make it as a start to activate the rest villages.</p>
